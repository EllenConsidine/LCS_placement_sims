### Which scripts were used to generate which figures and tables?

* Make_table1.R --> Table 1 in the main text, along with Table S7
* Boxplot_summary.R --> SI Figure A.2
* EDA_figures_tables.R --> SI Table B.1 (and SI Table C.1), which is then used to generate Table 1 with Normalize_table_1.R; also SI Figure A.1 and the correlation between the Pollution Score and Di et al. annual averages of PM2.5
* Explore_AQI_cutoffs.R --> SI Table A.2
* Make_figure-1_maps.R --> Figure 1 _(who would have guessed)_
* Plot_multiple_MEs.R --> Figures 3-5
* Plot_multiple_MEs_SI.R --> SI Figures B.1, B.2, C.1-C.5
* Simulate_cities_N.R --> SI Table A.3
* Summarize_MEs.R --> first column of Table 2 (other columns were obtained from Print_Table-2.R); same for SI Table C.2
* Visualize_differential_MEs.R --> SI Figure A.3

#### Not included as scripts here:
* Figure 2, from Google Drawings
* SI Table A.1, commented at the bottom of Calibrate_PA.R in Analysis main folder
